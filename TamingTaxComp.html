        For years now, there is a call by economists to set a minimum tax rate on capital at the global level. Arguments were theoretical at first (e.g. Baldwin and Krugman, 2004) and are now increasingly based on empirical analysis. In this period of unpreceding crisis due to COVID19, Laffitte et al. (2020) propose a minimum effective tax rate at 20% on the global profit of multinational firms. I think this is an interesting and important proposition, even if we can be skeptical about the possibility of this implementation due to the past failures to lead any kind of coordinations on that respect.

        But systemic crisis sometimes help people/governments to change their mind. Health is a common good, and in this pandemic situation we realize that it is also a global public good. This is obviously true for the environment and climate change, but also for our economies. How to finance these common goods? The big issue is the financial globalisation, the mobility of capital just impedes redistribution where international trade has negative side effects and reduces the capacity of many states to invest in health, education, infrastructure, climate change and so on.

        The <i>first best</i> may be a global institution, but we speak about TAXES, so about the DNA of national governments, no chance that they will lose their sovereignity on that subject (even if, in fact, they lose it everyday due to capital mobility...).

        So the <i>second best</i>, is indeed a common tax on corporations and a minimum level at 20% has some chance to be accepted by big players. Not sure for Trump, but Joe Biden for instance proposes to raise the current taxe at 25%.

        The<i> third best</i> is to set such a tax in all european countries at least.

        Just to be sure that you all know well the situation, I document below the growing impossibility of countries to set a tax on capital (this post is based on Candau and Le Cacheux, 2018).

        European and international rules of taxation are archaic.

        In the current system, profits are generally taxed according to the source based principle, i.e. where profits have been reported, while interest and royalty payments are deductible at source and taxed in the residence country of the recipient. Initially designed in the 1920s, under the auspices of the League of Nations
