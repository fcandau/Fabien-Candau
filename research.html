    <p>Co-authored with Tchapo Gbandi. 
      </p>  
      <p><em> We found that climatic conditions, such as higher temperatures and lower precipitation, directly lead to a higher likelihood of signing Water Treaties in the short run, and even more so in the long run. By analyzing the impact of changes in climatic conditions observed between 1961-1975 and 1993-2007, we found that a one-degree Celsius increase in temperature has resulted in a 16.6% increase in the likelihood of signing WTs.</em></p>

    <p><em>  International trade is a partial solution to climate change by reallocating agricultural production on a global scale. This article constructs an indicator of water's capacity to produce agricultural goods, and shows how climate change may alter countries' Ricardian comparative advantages in 2050.</em></p>

    Pollution Haven and Corruption Paradise. <i>Journal of Environmental Economics and Management</i>, 85, 171-192, 2017. [<a href="https://www.freit.org/WorkingPapers/Papers/ForeignInvestment/FREIT925.pdf">Working Paper</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeem.2017.05.005">DOI</a>]
    <p>Co-authored with Elisa Dienesch. </p>
    <p><em>Trade integration promotes pollution havens: a 1% increase in access to the European market from a pollution haven fosters relocation there by 0.1%. We also find that corruption lowers environmental standards, which strongly attract polluting firms: a 1% increase of corruption fuels relocation by 0.28%.</em></p>

   <p><em> The rise and fall of mega-cities are mainly explained by institutions and in particular by the rise of democratization (not international trade or market access!). 
 We argue that European colonialism has led to the development of inclusive institutions in previously poor areas which has favored agglomeration economies in urban giants. In contrast, introducing extractive institutions in previously prosperous areas has led to the dispersion of the population. </em></p>

   <p>Co-authored with Elisa Dienesch. </p>  
   <p><em> The spatial sorting of heterogeneous talented individuals, by impacting spatially on the opportunity cost to invest in skill acquisition, influences the regional creation of human capital. First a regional divergence in education investment occurs and then a convergence. The empirical analysis confirms that regional trade integration has been a determinant of the spatial distribution of skills in the USA.</em></p>
