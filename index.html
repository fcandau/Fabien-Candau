    <h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>
Welcome to my webpage! I am professor of economics at UPPA (UMR TREE) in France. You can contact me at fabien.candau@univ-pau.fr 
I work on environmental issues often related to globalization (such as pollution havens or the effects of climate change on the comparative advantage of countries). 
I am also interested by various other topics in international trade and urban economics.
